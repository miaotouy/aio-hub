Body
application/json
​
model
stringrequired
Corresponding Model Name. To better enhance service quality, we will make periodic changes to the models provided by this service, including but not limited to model on/offlining and adjustments to model service capabilities. We will notify you of such changes through appropriate means such as announcements or message pushes where feasible. For a complete list of available models, please check the Models.

Example:
"Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509"

Example:
"an island near sea, with seagulls, moon shining over the sea, light house, boats int he background, fish flying over the sea"

negative prompt

​
image_size
string
Image resolution in "widthxheight" format (Required). To ensure optimal quality, using the recommended values for your model is strongly advised. Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 and Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit not support this field.
Recommended Values:

For Kolor model:
"1024x1024" (1:1)
"960x1280" (3:4)
"768x1024" (3:4)
"720x1440" (1:2)
"720x1280" (9:16)
For Qwen-Image model:
"1328x1328" (1:1)
"1664x928" (16:9)
"928x1664" (9:16)
"1472x1140" (4:3)
"1140x1472" (3:4)
"1584x1056" (3:2)
"1056x1584" (2:3)
​
batch_size
integerdefault:1
number of output images. Only applicable to Kwai-Kolors/Kolors.

Required range: 1 <= x <= 4
​
seed
integer
Required range: 0 <= x <= 9999999999
​
num_inference_steps
integerdefault:20
number of inference steps

Required range: 1 <= x <= 100
​
guidance_scale
numberdefault:7.5
This value is used to control the degree of match between the generated image and the given prompt. The higher the value, the more the generated image will tend to strictly match the text prompt. The lower the value, the more creative and diverse the generated image will be, potentially containing more unexpected elements. Only applicable to Kwai-Kolors/Kolors.

Required range: 0 <= x <= 20
​
cfg
number
CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) is a technique that adjusts how closely generated outputs follow input prompts by balancing precision and creativity. This field is only applicable to Qwen/Qwen-Image models. For text generation scenarios, the CFG value must be greater than 1. The official configuration uses 50 steps with CFG 4.0. When CFG is set too small, it becomes nearly impossible to generate text.

Required range: 0.1 <= x <= 20
​
